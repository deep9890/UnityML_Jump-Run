## UnityML Jump & Run

This project is developed using Unity Framework implementing Reinforcement Learning algorithm PPO to train the ML-Agent to Jump & Run and earn Reward points by jumping over obstacles and collecting coins.

## Levels of Game

There are 5 levels in the game

Level 1 :  The agent needs to jump over cars that are all of the same height. Moreover, coins are placed on ground level. Since the agent tries to earn the maximum   reward, it needs to jump at the right times to avoid cars but collect the coins on the ground.

Level 2 : The obstacle does not change but the coins are now at different heights so the agent needs to time more jumps.

Level 3 : The distance between obstacles gets shorter as the agent progresses.

Level 4 : Introduced a new obstacles, a wall, that has a different height than the cars. Also, the distance between the obstacles is minimized as the game progresses.

Level 5 : Both types of coins appear at the same time in different heights, so the agent has to prioritize which coin to collect for the maximum reward.
